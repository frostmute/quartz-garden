# Welcome to the Garden 🌱

This is a digital garden — a collection of thoughts, notes, and ideas that grow over time.

## How to Use

- **Open in Obsidian**: Point Obsidian to `quartz-garden/content/`
- **Add notes**: Create `.md` files in this folder
- **Link notes**: Use `[[WikiLinks]]` to connect ideas
- **Auto-publish**: Changes pushed to GitHub automatically deploy

## Getting Started

1. Open this folder as a vault in Obsidian
2. Create new notes with `Ctrl/Cmd + N`
3. Use templates from the `templates/` folder
4. Commit and push — your site updates automatically
